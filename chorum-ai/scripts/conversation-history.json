    "objective": "Implementing User Initialization\n\nThe user's main objective is to ensure that new users, whether they sign up via OAuth (Google) or email/password, have a seamless experience with all application features and settings properly initialized. This includes fixing bugs that prevent settings from loading and ensuring consistent user data across authentication methods.\n\nKey goals:\n- Create a centralized `ensureUserExists` helper function.\n- Update API endpoints (`/api/settings`, `/api/chat`) to use the helper.\n- Ensure user records are created for OAuth users in the callback route.\n- Create `/api/auth/init-user` endpoint for email/password signups.\n- Update the login page to call the init-user endpoint.\n- Add a logout button to the settings sidebar and implement the logout functionality.\n- Commit and push all changes, and check for database migrations.\n- Provide manual testing instructions due to browser automation issues."

This involves:\n1. **Updating dependencies:** Replacing `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` with `@supabase/ssr`.\n2. **Refactoring code:** Modifying `src/middleware.ts`, `src/lib/supabase-client.ts`, `src/app/login/page.tsx`, and `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` to correctly utilize the new `@supabase/ssr` client creation and session management functions.\n3. **Restoring build functionality:** Eliminating the `Export createMiddlewareClient doesn't exist` error to allow the application to build successfully.\n4. **Maintaining authentication features:** Ensuring that both Google OAuth and email/password login, along with the implemented login tracking, continue to function correctly after the migration."
