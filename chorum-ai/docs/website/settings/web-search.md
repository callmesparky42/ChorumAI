# Web Search Settings

ChorumAI integrates with Serper (Google Search API) to provide real-time information to LLMs. This allows models to answer questions about current events, sports scores, stock prices, and more.

## Configuring Search

Navigate to **Settings > Web Search** to configure the search provider.

### 1. Enable Web Search
Toggle the **Enable Web Search** switch to turn the feature on or off globally. When enabled, a `web_search` tool is injected into the chat context, allowing the model to decide when to search the internet.

### 2. API Key Configuration
You need a Serper API key to use this feature.
1.  Get a free API key at [serper.dev](https://serper.dev).
2.  Enter the key in the **Serper API Key** field.
3.  Click **Test & Save**. Chorum will validate the key by making a test request.

### 3. Usage & Privacy
- **Privacy**: Search queries are sent to Serper (Google). Your main chat content is NOT sent, only the specific search query generated by the LLM.
- **Cost**: Serper offers a free tier (usually 2,500 queries). Check their pricing for details.
- **Local Models**: This feature works with local models (like Ollama) as long as they support tool calling or can be prompted to use tools.

## Tips
- **Explicit Queries**: You can explicitly ask the model to "search the web for X" to force a search.
- **Observation**: When a search happens, you'll see a search indicator in the response metadata with the number of search queries performed.
