# Welcome to Chorum

**Multi-provider LLM orchestration with intelligent agent routing, cost optimization, and peer review.**

You've just discovered Chorum — an AI chat interface that's smarter about how it uses AI. Instead of locking you into one provider, Chorum intelligently routes your questions to the best AI for the job, tracks your spending, and actually learns from your conversations.

## What Makes Chorum Different?

### The Chorus, Not a Solo Act

Most AI chat apps give you one model. Chorum gives you a **chorus** — multiple AI providers working together, each playing to their strengths.

| When You Ask | Chorum Routes To | Why |
|--------------|------------------|-----|
| "Analyze this architecture" | Claude Opus (Reasoning Tier) | Deep thinking, nuanced analysis |
| "Write this email" | Claude Sonnet (Balanced Tier) | Fast, creative, cost-effective |
| "Summarize these 10 pages" | Claude Haiku (Fast Tier) | Speed-first, token-efficient |

You can always override and pick your own provider. But if you're like us and want to optimize for cost *and* quality, let the router do its thing.

### Memory That Actually Remembers

Ever had an AI forget something you told it three messages ago? Yeah, us too.

Chorum's memory system is different. It doesn't just remember what you said — it remembers **what you meant**:

- **Projects** = Separate memory spaces for each thing you're working on
- **Patterns** = Things you do consistently that the AI should know
- **Decisions** = Choices you made and why you made them
- **Invariants** = Rules that should never be broken

When you switch projects or start a new conversation, your AI already knows the context.

### 14 Specialized Agents

Instead of one generic assistant, Chorum has specialized personas for different tasks:

| Need This? | Use This Agent |
|------------|----------------|
| Pattern analysis | **Analyst** |
| System design | **Architect** |
| Code review | **Code Reviewer** |
| Bug hunting | **Debugger** |
| Research | **Researcher** |
| Writing | **Writer** |
| Learning something | **Tutor** |
| Task breakdown | **Planner** |

Each agent has its own personality, approach, and model preferences. You can even create your own.

### Phone a Friend

Not sure if the AI got it right? Click "Get second opinion" and a *different* AI reviews the first one's work. Claude answers, GPT reviews. Or vice versa.

It's like having a second expert double-check your homework.

## This Is My First App

Full disclosure: I built Chorum because I wanted it to exist. It's my first real app, and I'm shipping it because I think it's useful — not because it's perfect.

If you find bugs, weird behavior, or just want to say hi, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback.
