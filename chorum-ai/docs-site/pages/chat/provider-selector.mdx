# Provider Selector

How to manually choose your AI provider.

---

## Accessing the Selector

Click the **provider pill** in the chat header:

```
╭─────────────────╮
│ 🤖 Claude Sonnet │  ← Click this
╰─────────────────╯
```

A dropdown appears with all your configured providers.

## The Options

### Auto (Recommended)

Let Chorum decide. The router picks based on:
- Task type detected from your message
- Available budget
- Provider capabilities
- Cost optimization

For most people, this is the right choice.

### Specific Provider

Force a specific provider:
- **Claude Sonnet** — Fast, capable, good default
- **Claude Opus** — Best reasoning, higher cost
- **GPT-4 Turbo** — Strong all-rounder
- **GPT-4o** — Faster GPT-4
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** — Long context, multimodal
- **Ollama** — Local, free, private
- **LM Studio** — Local, free, private

### Why Force a Provider?

| Reason | Pick |
|--------|------|
| Need best quality | Claude Opus, GPT-4 |
| Want consistent voice | Stick to one provider |
| Processing huge context | Gemini 1.5 Pro |
| Privacy-sensitive task | Ollama (local) |
| Out of API credits | Local models |
| Comparing outputs | Force different ones |

## Selection Persists

Your selection persists for the current conversation. If you pick Claude Opus, all messages in this conversation use Claude Opus.
