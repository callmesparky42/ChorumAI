# Using the Chat

The chat interface is where you talk to the chorus. Here's everything you need to know.

## The Layout

└─────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Three-Panel Design
- **Sidebar** (left): Projects, conversations, settings
- **Chat Panel** (center): Where the conversation happens
- **Context Panel** (right): Shows what memory is being used (toggle with button)

All panels are resizable. Drag the borders.

## Sending Messages

Type your message in the input box at the bottom and hit **Enter** (or click Send).

### Attaching Images
Click the 📎 icon or drag-and-drop images into the chat. Vision-capable models (GPT-4V, Claude 3) can analyze them.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Send message | `Enter` |
| New line | `Shift + Enter` |
| Toggle context | Button in header |

## The Provider Pill

Look at the header of the chat panel. You'll see something like:

```
╭─────────────────────────────────────╮
│ 🤖 Claude Sonnet  │  $0.002  │  ⚙️ │
╰─────────────────────────────────────╯
```

This tells you:
- **Which AI** is currently responding
- **Cost so far** for this session
- **Settings** access

### Changing Providers

Click the provider name to open the selector. You can:
- **Let Chorum decide** (Auto mode) — routes based on task type
- **Force a specific provider** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or local models

Why force? Maybe you want Claude's writing style, or GPT's code generation, or you want to use a free local model.

---

## Messages

Each message shows:
- **Who sent it** (you or the AI)
- **The content** (with markdown rendering)
- **Cost** (for AI responses)

### Message Actions

Hover over an AI response to see:
- **📋 Copy** — Copy to clipboard
- **🔄 Regenerate** — Try again with fresh output
- **🤝 Get Second Opinion** — Trigger peer review

---

## Cost Tracking

Bottom-right of Each Message shows the cost:
```
$0.0012 (43 in / 127 out)
```

This means:
- **$0.0012** spent on this response
- **43 tokens** sent to the AI
- **127 tokens** received back

### Session Total

The header shows your running total for this session. Resets when you close the browser.

### Don't Want to See Costs?

Some people find it distracting. You can hide it in Settings → Preferences (coming soon).

---

## The Context Panel

Click the toggle button in the header to show/hide the context panel.

This shows you **what memory was injected** into the AI's context:
- Patterns from this project
- Relevant decisions
- Invariants being enforced

It's useful for debugging why the AI knows (or doesn't know) something.

---

## Conversations

Each chat session is a conversation. You can:

- **Start a new one**: Click "New Chat" in sidebar
- **Continue an old one**: Click any conversation in the sidebar
- **Name them**: Click the title to edit

Conversations belong to projects. Switch projects to see different conversation lists.

## Tips

### Use Projects for Context Switch
Don't mix topics in one project. Create separate projects for:
- Work stuff
- Learning projects
- Side projects
- Personal AI experiments

Each project has its own memory, so the AI won't mix up contexts.

### Let Auto Mode Work
Unless you have a specific reason, let Chorum pick the provider. The router considers:
- What you're asking
- Cost per token
- Provider capabilities
- Your budget limits

### Use Agents for Specialized Tasks
Instead of just chatting, pick a specific agent for structured tasks:
- Need analysis? Use **Analyst**
- Need code reviewed? Use **Code Reviewer**
- Need to learn something? Use **Tutor**
