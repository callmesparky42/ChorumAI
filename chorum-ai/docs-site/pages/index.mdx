# Chorum AI Documentation

**Chorum remembers your projects so you don't have to.**

Stop re-explaining your codebase every AI conversation. Chorum learns your patterns, decisions, and conventions—then injects them when they matter. Use any LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models) with context that persists and compounds over time.

Self-hosted. Encrypted. No ads. No tracking.
