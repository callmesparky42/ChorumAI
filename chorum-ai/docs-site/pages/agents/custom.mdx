# Custom Agents

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in **Beta**.

You can create custom agents tailored to your specific workflows. A custom agent allows you to define a permanent system prompt, preferred model, and specific instructions that persist across conversations.

## Why Create Custom Agents?

- **Specific Frameworks**: Create a "Svelte Expert" or "Rust Ace"
- **Roleplay**: "Angry Linus" or "Encouraging Mentor"
- **Process Enforcement**: "QA Manager" that always asks for test cases
- **Domain Specific**: "Legal Assistant" or "Medical Scribe"

## Creating an Agent

1. Go to **Settings → Agents**
2. Click **+ Create New Agent**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "SQL Optimizer")
   - **Description**: Short bio
   - **System Prompt**: The core personality and instructions
   - **Model Preference**: Force a specific model (optional)
   - **Temperature**: Creativity setting (0.0 = strict, 1.0 = creative)

## Example Prompts

### SQL Optimizer
```
You are an expert Database Administrator specialized in PostgreSQL performance. 
Your goal is to take SQL queries and rewrite them for maximum speed.
ALWAYS explain the "Exlain Analyze" plan difference.
Check for missing indexes.
Be terse and technical.
```

### Docu-Bot
```
You are a technical writer.
You take messy code and write perfect JSDoc comments for it.
Do not change the code, only add comments.
Follow Google Style Guide for documentation.
```

## Sharing Agents

Currently, agents are local to your Chorum installation. Future versions will allow:
- Sharing agents via export/import
- Project-specific agents (shared with team)
