# Managing Projects

Beyond distinct memory spaces, projects allow for granular control over how your AI behaves in different contexts.

## Custom Instructions

You can set custom instructions that apply to *every* message within a project.

**Where:** Settings → Project → Custom Instructions

**Use Cases:**
- "Always respond with TypeScript code examples"
- "Prefer functional programming style"
- "Assume the user is a senior engineer—be concise"
- "Use British English spelling"

These instructions are injected into the system prompt alongside retrieved memory.

---

## Tech Stack Definition

Explicitly defining your tech stack saves you from repeating "I'm using Next.js" in every conversation.

**Where:** Settings → Project → Tech Stack

**Format:** Comma-separated list or short description.

**Examples:**
- `Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Supabase`
- `Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic`
- `Go 1.21, Chi router, pgx`

## Exporting Project Data

You can export data for a specific project without exporting your entire vault.

1. Go to **Settings → Sovereignty**
2. Select **Export Project**
3. Choose the project to export
4. Save the encrypted `.chorum` file

This file works just like a full backup but contains only one project's memory. Useful for sharing context with a teammate (if you share the passphrase).

---

## Archiving vs. Deleting

Currently, Chorum supports deletion but not "archiving" in a dedicated state.

**To simulate archiving:**
1. Export the project to a file
2. Store the file securely (e.g., "archive-project-x.chorum")
3. Delete the project from Chorum

To restore, simply **Import** the file later.

## Project ID

Each project has a unique UUID (e.g., `proj_1234...`).

**Finding the ID:**
- It's visible in the URL bar when you're in the project
- Also shown in **Settings → Project**

You'll need this ID when using the **CLI** or **API** to interact with a specific project programmatically.
