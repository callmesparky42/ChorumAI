# H4X0R CLI Overview

The Chorum CLI (codenamed **H4X0R**) lets you interact with your memory system directly from the terminal.

## Why Use the CLI?

- **Batch Operations**: Import/export multiple projects
- **Scripting**: Automate memory snapshots or management
- **Quick Access**: Query memory without opening the browser
- **MCP Server**: Runs the local server for IDE integration

---

## Installation

The CLI is included with the Chorum project. To use it globally, link it:

```bash
cd chorum-ai
npm link
```

Now you can run `chorum` anywhere.

---

## Basic Usage

```bash
chorum <command> [options]
```

To see available commands:

```bash
chorum --help
```

---

## Authentication

The CLI shares authentication with your local Chorum instance.

1. **Login**: `chorum login` (opens browser if needed)
2. **Status**: `chorum status` (checks connection to local server)

---

## MCP Server Mode

The primary use of the CLI is running the MCP server for IDEs.

```bash
npx chorum-mcp
```

This starts the server in stdio mode, which tools like Claude Desktop and Cursor use to communicate.

→ See **[MCP Setup](../mcp/setup.md)** for configuration details.
