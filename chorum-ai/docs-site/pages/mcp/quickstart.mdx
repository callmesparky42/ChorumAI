# 5-Minute MCP Setup

**Keep using Cursor. Just add memory.**

Your IDE agent forgets everything between sessions. Chorum fixes that. In 5 minutes, your AI will remember your project's patterns, decisions, and conventions—without you repeating yourself.

---

## Before & After

**Without Chorum:**
> "Build the auth endpoint"  
> *AI invents new patterns, ignores your httpOnly cookie rule, uses localStorage*

**With Chorum MCP:**
> "Build the auth endpoint"  
> *AI knows you use JWT + httpOnly cookies, follows your established patterns*

---

## Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Get Your API Token

Visit [chorumai.com/app](https://chorumai.com/app) → **Settings** → **MCP Integration** → **New Token**

Copy it immediately—it won't be shown again.

### 2. Configure Your IDE

Add this to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chorum": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["chorum-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHORUM_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Config file locations:**
- **Claude Code:** `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`
- **Cursor:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf:** Settings → MCP Servers

### 3. Restart Your IDE

That's it. Your AI agent now has persistent memory.

---

## What Happens Next

Once connected, your IDE agent can:

- **Query your memory** — Ask "what's our auth pattern?" and get real answers
- **Respect invariants** — It knows "never use localStorage for tokens"
- **Propose learnings** — When it discovers a new pattern, it can suggest adding it

You approve all new learnings in the [Chorum web UI](https://chorumai.com/app). The agent reads, you control what it writes.

---

## Try It Now

Ask your agent:

> "What patterns does this project follow?"

If it returns your actual patterns, you're connected. If it says "I don't have access to that information," check [troubleshooting](./setup#troubleshooting).

## Want the Full Experience?

The MCP server gives your IDE memory. The web app gives you:

| Feature | MCP Only | Web App |
|---------|----------|---------|
| IDE agent has memory | ✅ | ✅ |
| Visual memory dashboard | ❌ | ✅ |
| Peer review across providers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cost tracking | ❌ | ✅ |
| Approve/edit learnings | via web | ✅ |

**Recommendation:** Use both. MCP for coding, web app for reviewing and managing memory.
