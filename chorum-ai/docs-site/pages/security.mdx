# Security & Privacy

Chorum is built for developers who take security seriously. This page is your one-stop reference for how we protect your data.

---

## The Short Version

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where is my data stored? | Your machine (encrypted) |
| Who can read my memory? | Only you |
| Do cloud providers see my prompts? | Yes, if you use cloud LLMs |
| Can I run fully offline? | Yes, with Ollama/LM Studio |
| Is there telemetry? | No |
| Can I export my data? | Yes, anytime |

---

## Threat Model

**What Chorum protects against:**

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| Someone with filesystem access | Sees encrypted blobs only |
| Accidental git commit of config | Useless ciphertext |
| Cloud backup (iCloud/Dropbox) | Syncs encrypted noise |
| Vendor disappears | You have portable export |
| Network sniffing | TLS/HTTPS enforced |
| PII in prompts | Client-side redaction before sending |

**What Chorum doesn't protect against:**

| Threat | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| LLM provider sees your prompts | Unavoidable for cloud models (use local models for maximum privacy) |
| Content in RAM during request | Cleartext temporarily—no disk writes |
| Compromised machine | If your machine is owned, all bets are off |

---

## Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** before writing to disk. The key is derived from your passphrase using Argon2id—Chorum never sees or stores your key.

```
Your Passphrase
      ↓
  Argon2id (KDF)
      ↓
  256-bit Key
      ↓
  AES-256-GCM Encryption
      ↓
  Encrypted blob on disk
```

**Technical details:** [Encryption Documentation →](./sovereignty/encryption)

## PII Redaction

Before data leaves your machine for an LLM, Chorum can automatically detect and redact:

| Detected | Replaced With |
|----------|---------------|
| Email addresses | `[EMAIL_REDACTED]` |
| Phone numbers | `[PHONE_REDACTED]` |
| SSNs | `[SSN_REDACTED]` |
| Credit card numbers | `[CC_REDACTED]` |

This runs **client-side in your browser**—the data never leaves in cleartext.

## Compliance Mapping

Chorum's security features map to common compliance frameworks:

| Requirement | GDPR | SOC 2 | HIPAA | Chorum Feature |
|-------------|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Data encryption at rest | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | AES-256-GCM |
| Data portability | ✓ | | | Export/Import |
| Access controls | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Token-based auth |
| Audit logging | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Local audit logs |
| Data minimization | ✓ | | ✓ | PII redaction |

> **Note:** Chorum provides features that support compliance—it does not guarantee compliance. Consult your compliance officer for your specific use case.

---

## Audit Logging

When enabled, Chorum logs every LLM request locally:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:23:45Z",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-3-sonnet",
  "tokens": { "input": 1523, "output": 847 },
  "cost": 0.0034,
  "securityFlags": {
    "httpsEnforced": true,
    "piiDetected": false
  }
}
```

Logs stay on your machine. Export them anytime via **Settings → Security → Download Audit Logs**.

---

## Local-Only Mode

For maximum security, run Chorum with zero cloud exposure:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Add the local provider in Settings
3. Disable all cloud providers

In this mode, **nothing leaves your machine**. Your prompts, responses, and memory stay entirely local.
