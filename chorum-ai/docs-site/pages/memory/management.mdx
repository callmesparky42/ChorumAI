# Memory Management

Chorum's memory dashboard lets you view, edit, and organize all the patterns, decisions, and invariants your AI has learned.

## Why This Matters

Automatic learning is great, but you need control. Maybe an extracted pattern is wrong. Maybe a decision has changed. Maybe you want to add something the AI missed. The memory dashboard gives you that control.

---

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Go to **Memory & Learning**
3. Select **Learned Knowledge**

You'll see the full memory dashboard for your current project.

## Dashboard Layout

### Project Selector

Switch between projects using the dropdown at the top. Each project has its own isolated memory.

### Summary Cards

Quick stats for your current project:

| Card | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| Invariants | Count of active rules |
| Patterns | Count of coding patterns |
| Critical Files | Key files identified |
| Confidence | Current confidence score |

### Conductor Health Card

At the top of the knowledge tab, the Conductor Health card shows aggregate memory state: item counts by type, pinned/muted/promoted counts, your most-used items, and items approaching decay threshold.

> See **[Conductor Health](./conductor.md#conductor-health)** for details.

### Learning Lists

Expandable sections for each learning type:
- **Invariants** — Rules that must not be broken
- **Patterns** — Coding conventions and approaches
- **Decisions** — Technical choices with rationale
- **Golden Paths** — Step-by-step procedures and recipes
- **Antipatterns** — Things to avoid

Each item shows edit, delete, pin, and mute actions.

---

## Viewing Learnings

Click on any section header to expand it and see all learnings of that type.

![Invariants List](/images/memory-invariants-list.png)

Each learning shows:
- **Content** — The actual learning text
- **Context** — Why this was learned (if provided)
- **Source** — Where it came from (analyzer, claude-code, manual, etc.)
- **Date** — When it was added
- **Status badges** — Pinned (blue), Muted (dimmed), Promoted (star)
- **Actions** — Pin, Mute, Edit, and Delete buttons

---

## Adding a Learning

### Manual Addition

1. Click **+ Add Learning Item**
2. A modal appears with:
   - **Type selector** — Choose Pattern, Decision, Invariant, or Antipattern
   - **Content** — The learning itself
   - **Context** — Optional: why this matters
3. Click **Save**

### Tips for Good Learnings

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific to your project | Add generic advice |
| Include the "why" | Just state facts |
| Keep it actionable | Be vague |
| One concept per learning | Pack multiple ideas |

**Good examples:**
```
✓ "Use early returns to reduce nesting—maintain 2-level max indent"
✓ "Chose PostgreSQL over SQLite for multi-user support and better indexing"
✓ "Never log user emails or PII to console—use redacted placeholders"
```

**Bad examples:**
```
✗ "Write good code" (too vague)
✗ "TypeScript is better than JavaScript" (not actionable)
✗ "Use functions" (too generic)
```

## Editing Learnings

1. Find the learning you want to edit
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon
3. Modify the content or type
4. Click **Save**

Common reasons to edit:
- Fix typos or unclear wording
- Update after circumstances change
- Add missing context
- Change learning type (e.g., pattern → invariant)

---

## Pinning & Muting Learnings

Beyond editing and deleting, you can **pin** and **mute** individual learnings to steer what the [Conductor](./conductor.md) injects.

### Pinning ("Always Remember This")

Pinned items are **always injected** into context regardless of their relevance score. Use this for knowledge that's critical to every conversation in your project.

1. Find the learning you want to pin
2. Click the **Pin** icon (or "Always remember this" in casual mode)
3. The item gets a blue accent and pin badge

**When to pin:**
- Project-defining rules ("All API routes require auth")
- Foundational decisions you never want the AI to forget
- Safety-critical invariants

**Note:** Pinned items consume token budget. Pinning too many items may crowd out dynamically scored items.

### Muting ("I Know This Already")

Muted items are **never injected** but remain stored in your memory. They still participate in co-occurrence tracking and can be unmuted at any time.

1. Find the learning you want to mute
2. Click the **Mute** icon (or "I know this already" in casual mode)
3. The item appears dimmed with reduced opacity

**When to mute:**
- Lessons you've internalized and no longer need reminders about
- Temporarily irrelevant items (e.g., patterns for a feature branch you're not working on)
- Items that keep appearing but aren't useful for your current work

**Muting vs. Deleting:** Muting is reversible — unmute anytime to restore injection. Deleting is permanent. When in doubt, mute.

### Giving Feedback

After each response, the Conductor Trace shows what was injected. You can give thumbs up or thumbs down on individual items:

- **Thumbs up** — Strengthens the item's co-occurrence signals, improving future retrieval
- **Thumbs down** — Weakens co-occurrence signals for this item in this context

Over time, feedback trains the Conductor to surface better knowledge combinations.

---

## Deleting Learnings

1. Find the learning to delete
2. Click the **Delete** (trash) icon
3. Confirm the deletion

**When to delete:**
- Learning is outdated (you've changed approach)
- Learning was extracted incorrectly
- Learning is duplicate of another
- Project direction has changed

**Note:** Deleted learnings can't be recovered. If you're unsure, consider [muting](#muting-i-know-this-already) instead.

---

## Reviewing Pending Learnings

When the analyzer or an MCP agent proposes a learning, it goes to the **Pending Learnings** queue.

### The Review Flow

1. Go to **Memory & Learning → Pending Learnings**
2. You'll see all proposals waiting for review
3. For each proposal:
   - **Source** — Who proposed it (analyzer, claude-code, cursor, etc.)
   - **Type** — What kind of learning
   - **Content** — The proposed text
   - **Context** — Why it was proposed

### Actions

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Approve ✓** | Add to memory as-is |
| **Edit** | Modify before approving |
| **Deny ✗** | Reject the proposal |

### Best Practices

- Review regularly (daily if using MCP agents actively)
- Don't let the queue grow too large
- Edit proposals to be more specific if needed
- Deny duplicates or off-target proposals

## Bulk Operations

### Exporting Learnings

To export your project's learnings:

1. Go to **Settings → Sovereignty → Export**
2. Your learnings are included in the encrypted export

### Importing Learnings

When importing from a `.chorum` file:
1. Go to **Settings → Sovereignty → Import**
2. Learnings from the imported file merge with existing ones
3. Conflicts are flagged for resolution

→ See **[Export/Import](../sovereignty/export-import.md)** for details.

## Memory Health Indicators

Watch for these signs your memory needs attention:

| Indicator | What It Means | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Confidence dropping | Inactive or stale data | Use project more, add fresh learnings |
| Many pending learnings | Review queue backed up | Review and approve/deny |
| Conflicting patterns | Contradictory learnings | Edit or delete one |
| Items approaching decay | May be outdated | Review — pin if still valuable, or let them decay |
| Many muted items | Might be over-muting | Review muted items — unmute or delete |
| No pinned items | Missing guaranteed context | Pin your most critical rules and decisions |

---

## FAQ

### How many learnings can I have?

There's no hard limit, but practical considerations:
- **Performance** — Thousands of learnings may slow scoring
- **Relevance** — More learnings means more noise to filter
- **Quality** — Better to have 50 great learnings than 500 mediocre ones

### Can I reorder learnings?

Learnings aren't ordered—they're scored by relevance for each query. Recent, frequently-used learnings naturally score higher.

### Do deleted learnings affect confidence?

Yes, slightly. Deleting learnings removes their contribution to confidence, but the effect is small unless you delete many.

### Can I share learnings between projects?

Not directly, but you can:
1. Export project A
2. Create project B
3. Import project A's data and resolve what you want to keep

Future versions may support cross-project learning sharing.
