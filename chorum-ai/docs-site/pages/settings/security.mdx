## Security Settings Overview

![Security Settings](/images/security.jpg)

Access via **Settings → Security**.

---

## Available Options

### Enforce HTTPS Only

**Status**: Toggle on/off

Requires encrypted HTTPS connections for all external API calls. When enabled:
- Requests to HTTP endpoints are blocked
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Localhost connections (Ollama, LM Studio) are exempt

**Recommendation**: Keep enabled unless debugging.

---

### Anonymize PII

**Status**: Toggle on/off

Automatically detects and redacts personally identifiable information before sending to LLM providers:

| Detected | Replaced With |
|----------|---------------|
| Email addresses | `[EMAIL_REDACTED]` |
| Phone numbers | `[PHONE_REDACTED]` |
| SSNs | `[SSN_REDACTED]` |
| Credit card numbers | `[CC_REDACTED]` |

This runs **client-side** before any data leaves your browser.

**Recommendation**: Enable if working with sensitive data.

---

### Strict SSL Verification

**Status**: Toggle on/off

Enforces full SSL/TLS certificate validation for local provider connections:
- When enabled, self-signed certificates will fail
- Required for enterprise setups with internal CAs
- Cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) always use strict SSL

**When to disable**: Development servers or home lab setups with self-signed certs.

---

### Audit Logging

**Status**: Toggle on/off

Records detailed logs of every LLM request:
- Provider and model used
- Timestamp
- Security flags (PII detected, HTTPS enforced)
- Cost

Logs stay **local** and are not sent to any external service.

**Use case**: Compliance (SOC2, HIPAA), debugging, cost analysis.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable HTTPS** — Always, unless testing locally
2. **Enable PII Anonymization** — If you ever paste customer data
3. **Disable Strict SSL** — Only for local/development models
4. **Enable Audit Logging** — For enterprise or regulated environments
