# Budget Management

Control your AI spending with daily budgets per provider.

## Why Budgets Matter

AI APIs charge per token. Without limits, a busy day could mean surprise bills. Chorum lets you set **per-provider daily caps** so you stay in control.

---

## Setting a Budget

When adding or editing a provider:

1. Enter the **Daily Budget ($)** field
2. This is the maximum Chorum will spend on that provider per day
3. Once reached, requests will route to other available providers

---

## Budget Display

The Providers tab shows your spending at a glance:

For each provider you'll see:
- **Spent Today** — Current usage in dollars
- **Daily Budget** — Your set limit
- **Progress Bar** — Visual indicator of remaining budget

## How Budget Enforcement Works

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Budget at 80% | Normal operation |
| Budget at 100% | Provider disabled for the day |
| All budgets exhausted | Error message (or local fallback if configured) |

---

## Multi-Provider Strategy

Smart budget allocation:

| Provider | Suggested Budget | Use Case |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Claude | $5/day | Complex reasoning |
| GPT-4 | $3/day | General tasks |
| Gemini | $2/day | Quick queries |
| Ollama | $0 (free) | Backup/offline |

This gives you $10/day total with local fallback.

## Tips

- **Budgets reset at midnight UTC**
- **$0 budget** means unlimited (use carefully!)
- **Local models** (Ollama, LM Studio) have no cost
- **Auto-routing** will prefer cheaper providers when quality is similar

---

## Tracking Total Spend

The top of the Providers tab shows:
- **Total Usage Today**: Sum across all providers
- **Total Daily Budget**: Sum of all individual budgets
