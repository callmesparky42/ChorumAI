# Changelog

All notable changes to ChorumAI will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Memory System
- **Deterministic Grounding**: Implemented a safety layer that verifies new learnings against recent conversation history to prevent "poison-pill" injections.
  - Added `verifyReference` check before committing memories.
  - Introduced **Source Tagging** (Provenance) to track which conversation and messages contributed to a memory.
- **Confidence Rescoring**: Introduced a dynamic confidence scoring formula for projects.
  - Formula: `(Interaction*0.3 + Verification*0.4 + Consistency*0.2 + Decay*0.1) * 100`

#### Verification
- Added `scripts/test-grounding.ts` and `scripts/test-confidence.ts` for validating memory logic.

### Changed

#### Library
- Updated `LearningItemMetadata` interface to include `provenance` data.
