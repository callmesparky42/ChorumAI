# What is ChorumAI?

**ChorumAI is the Agnostic Interface for the Age of AI Orchestration.**

In a landscape dominated by walled gardens and rapidly shifting model capabilities, Chorum is your neutral ground—a powerful, self-hosted command center that puts *you* in control of your AI interactions.

## The Chorum Philosophy

We believe the future of AI isn't about betting on a single winner—it's about orchestration. Chorum is built on three core pillars:

1.  **Agnostic Routing**: Never be locked into a single provider. Use Claude for reasoning, GPT 5.x for coding, and local Llama 3 or GLM4.x for privacy—all in the same thread.
2.  **Semantic Memory**: Your projects should get smarter over time. Chorum learns from every interaction, building a "project memory" that lives with your code, not in a model's training data.
3.  **Sovereignty**: Your data, your keys, your rules. Run entirely locally or route through your own cloud accounts.

## What Makes Chorum Special?

### 🧠 Semantic Memory System
Most chat apps have "goldfish memory"—they forget context the moment it scrolls off-screen. Chorum implements a **human-like learning process**:
- **Write Path**: A dedicated background analyzer observes your conversations to extract architectural decisions, coding patterns, and "invariants" (rules that must never be broken).
- **Read Path**: When you start a new task, Chorum proactively injects relevant wisdom from past projects into the agent's context. It feels less like a chatbot and more like a senior engineer who has been on the team for years.

### 🛡️ Ironclad Security
Security isn't an afterthought; it's the foundation.
- **PII Anonymization**: Sensitive data (emails, credit cards, phones) is automatically redacted *before* it leaves your machine.
- **Audit Trails**: Every token sent and received is logged locally, giving you a complete transparent history.
- **Strict HTTPS**: We enforce secure transport for all provider connections, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 🔌 BYOLLM (Bring Your Own LLM)
Chorum is the ultimate frontend for the local LLM revolution.
- **First-Class Local Support**: Seamlessly integrate with **Ollama** and **LM Studio**.
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Use a 70B cloud model for complex architecture planning, then switch to a local 7B model for writing boilerplate code—zero latency, zero cost.
- **Resilient Fallbacks**: If Anthropic goes down, Chorum automatically reroutes to OpenAI or your local fallback. Your work never stops.

### 🤖 Agentic Orchestration
Chorum isn't just a chat box; it's a team of specialized agents.
- **Role-Based Routing**: The "Architect" agent thinks differently than the "Copywriter" or "Researcher". Chorum selects the right persona and prompting strategy for the specific task at hand.
- **Peer Review**: Our unique "Phone a Friend" feature lets one model check another's work. Have Claude write the code and GPT 5.x review it for security vulnerabilities—automated pair programming at its finest.

## Why Chorum?

Chorum is for developers, creators, and power users who want the power of state-of-the-art AI without the vendor lock-in or data privacy compromises. It is the intelligent layer that sits *between* you and the raw intelligence, adding memory, security, and orchestration to every interaction.
